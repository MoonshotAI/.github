# Welcome to Moonshot AI

<a href="https://www.moonshot.cn/"><img src="moonshot.jpg" alt="icon" style="height: 16px; vertical-align: center;"> [Moonshot AI](https://moonshot.ai) is committed to solving ambitious "moonshot" problems that will lead humanity to AGI. We embrace open source, and contributed the following projects to the community:

## Research
* [Kimi K2](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-K2): our latest open-source Mixture-of-Experts model with 32B activated parameters and 1T total parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in frontier knowledge, math, and coding among non-thinking models. 
* [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/): pioneered the idea of KV-centric disaggregated LLM serving, winning the Best Paper award at FAST 2025. We released code and data corresponding to our paper.
* [Kimi-K1.5](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5): Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs. We released our tech report on building an o1-level multi-modal reasoning model.
* [Moonlight](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Moonlight) for our paper [Muon is Scalable for LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982). We released (i) checkpoints for SOTA small models; (ii) code for our improved Muon optimizer.
* [MoBA](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA): Mixture of Block Attention for Long-Context LLMs. We released code and paper for our looong-context LLM technique.
* [Kimi-VL](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-VL): Mixture-of-Experts Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Reasoning, Long-Context Understanding, and Strong Agent Capabilities
* [Kimina-Prover Preview](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimina-Prover-Preview): Towards Large Formal Reasoning Models with Reinforcement Learning. We released technical report, model weights and a rectified version of miniF2F-test benchmark.
* [Kimi-Audio](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio): Universal audio foundation model that handles diverse tasks like speech recognition, audio understanding, audio-to-text chat, speech-to-speech conversation. 
  We released the technical report, model weights and evaluation toolkit.
* [Kimi-Dev](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Dev): A Strong and Open-source Coding LLM for Issue Resolution. Kimi-Dev-72B achieves 60.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified. 

## Service and Infra

* [moonpalace](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/moonpalace): debugging tool for our API service.
* [checkpoint-engine](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/checkpoint-engine): efficiently update model weights in LLM serving
