# Welcome to Moonshot AI

<a href="https://www.moonshot.cn/"><img src="moonshot.jpg" alt="icon" style="height: 16px; vertical-align: center;"> [Moonshot AI](https://moonshot.ai) is committed to solving ambitious "moonshot" problems that will lead humanity to AGI. We embrace open source, and contributed the following projects to the community:

## Research

* [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/) pioneered the idea of KV-centric disaggregated LLM serving, winning the Best Paper award at FAST 2025. We released code and data corresponding to our paper.
* [Kimi-K1.5](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-k1.5): Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs. We released our tech report on building an O1-level multi-modal reasoning model.
* [Moonlight](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Moonlight) for our paper [Muon is Scalable for LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982). We released (i) checkpoints for SOTA small models; (ii) code for our improved Muon optimizer.
* [MoBA](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA): Mixture of Block Attention for Long-Context LLMs. We released code and paper for our looong-context LLM technique.


## API Service

* [MoonshotAI-Cookbook](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoonshotAI-Cookbook): examples on how to use our API service.
* [moonpalace](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/moonpalace): debugging tool for our API service.
